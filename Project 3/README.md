# Project 3: Constructing suffix trees from LCP and suffix arrays

We wrote a program gen-lcp that uses the construction algorithm from the previous project to generate a suffix tree. This suffix tree is then used to output a file that contains the suffix indices in lexicographical order and the LCP array.

We then wrote a program, search-st2, where we replaced the suffix tree construction algorithm that we wrote in the previous project with a new construction algorithm, which constructs the suffix tree from the LCP and suffix arrays as generated by gen-lcp.
